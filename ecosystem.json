Each iteration produces a unique piece that is stored on IPFS and indexed on the Tezos blockchain. The NFTs are are FA2 compliant, which means that they can be exchanged like any other NFT. The anaver.se is an open ecosystem by design. When a collector buys a version of an artist's asset from the artist themselves, they make this new version of the asset instantly available to all users. Minting hence makes the ecosystem richer for everyone.
